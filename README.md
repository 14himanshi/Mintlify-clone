# mintlify documentation clone

hello! this is my second project. i tried to make it look like mintlify.com. i used a lot of white space and the green color they use.

### sections i made
1. nav bar (with the sign in button)
2. hero (big title and email box)
3. docs preview (i made a sidebar on the left)
4. logos of companies
5. feature blocks
6. ai assistant (the black section)
7. enterprise features
8. stories from customers
9. final cta
10. footer links

### fonts and colors
- **font**: i used 'Inter' from google.
- **green**: #00D26A
- **gray**: #666 for the small text.

### how it works
i used `width: 1100px` for all my sections so they stay in the middle. i used `float: left` to put the text and images side by side. i also used `<br>` to make space between things.

thanks!
